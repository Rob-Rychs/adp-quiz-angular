App [DEMO]

This was the fastest and laziest solution for the adp-quiz in the history of RED Academy showcasing absolutely no programming skill whatsoever, besides a quick [npmsearch] and some semi-intelligent copy and pasting.

## ToDos

- programmatically assign quiz.json to correct data schema for package

- implement a 30 second timer upon the rendering of each question (ng2-quiz PR if you make it configurable)

## Developed with ng2-quiz

ng2-quiz is a general purpose quiz application developed in angular 2 that can be used for multiple purpose questions (TRUE or FALSE support coming soon).

- deployed using angular-cli-ghpages
